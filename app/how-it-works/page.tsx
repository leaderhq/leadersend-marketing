    a: "No. Never. The person receiving your card needs only a phone camera to scan your QR code. No app, no account, no friction on their side. That's intentional — every extra step they have to take is a lead you lose before the conversation even ends.",
  },
  {
    q: 'What if the venue wifi goes down?',
    a: 'Two things work completely offline after you\'ve opened them once. Event Mode saves your card locally the first time you load it — after that, the QR generates on-device with no server call, no wifi, no signal required. Your digital wallet card (Apple Wallet or Google Wallet) is stored on your device the moment you add it, available even in airplane mode. Open Event Mode once before you leave for the venue and you\'re covered. Hold up the screen, they scan, done.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does Memory Moment work exactly?',
    a: 'Memory Moment requires a contact first — the person needs to have scanned your card so they exist in your leads. Once they do, open that lead, tap Add Memory Moment, and it opens your camera. Take the photo together right there in the moment. LeaderLeads automatically stamps the date, time, and location on the image and emails it to both of you within seconds. No editing, no uploading, no extra steps from either side.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does it flow into my CRM?',
    a: "Every contact that engages with your card appears in your lead inbox with a timestamp. If you want it fully automatic — contacts flowing into your CRM the moment someone scans your card — that requires LeaderCRM, which is built to work hand-in-hand with LeaderLeads. For any other system (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.) you export or upload your contacts manually, or set up a Zapier automation yourself. Zapier can handle the transfer once configured, but it is not automatic out of the box.",
